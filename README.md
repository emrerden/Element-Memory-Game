# Element-Memory-Game
Element Memory GameAn interactive, chemistry-themed educational memory game developed using Java Swing and MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. This project aims to make learning chemical elements, symbols, and facts engaging and fun.🚀 Key FeaturesEducational Depth: Each correct match triggers a "Did You Know?" fact box about the element's real-world uses or interesting properties.Dynamic Difficulty Levels:🌱 Easy: 4 Pairs (8 Cards) - 2x4 Grid layout.⚡ Medium: 8 Pairs (16 Cards) - 4x4 Grid layout.🔥 Hard: 12 Pairs (24 Cards) - 4x6 Grid layout.Game Mechanics:Real-time Timer (implemented with javax.swing.Timer).Move Counter to track player performance.Navigation system with a Back to Menu feature for a seamless user experience.Visual Polish: A modern pastel color palette designed to reduce eye strain and interactive button effects.🏗️ Technical ArchitectureThe project follows the MVC Design Pattern to ensure clean code and separation of concerns:Model (Element.java): Manages the data structure for elements (name, symbol, fact, and group colors).View (MenuWindow, GameWindow, ElementButton): Handles the GUI components and user interface rendering.Controller (GameEngine, ActionListeners): Controls the game logic, matching algorithms, and state management.🛠️ Installation & UsageTo run this project locally, follow these steps:Clone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/element-memory-game.git
